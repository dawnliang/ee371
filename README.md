## Lab 1: Introduction
- Refamiliarise ourselves with verilog, Quartus
- Introduce us to iverilog & gtkwave and Signal Tap II
- Introduce to the C programming language in CodeBlocks

VHDL: Implemented four counters at various levels of abstraction: gate-level, dataflow, behavioural, and using Quartus' schematic entry. Compiled & simulated with iverilog and gtkwave, then downloaded to hardware through Quartus and probed using Signal Tap II.

C: Wrote a simple program that took inputs and output to the console.

## Lab 2: Canal Lock Control System
- Build a simple time-dependent system
- Introduce us to pointers in C

VHDL: Designed & built system for controlling canal locks. Main components involved overall system management (I/O's, control signals, overall state), with submodules for gate control (combinational) and inner water level control (enable-counter). Compiled & simulated with iverilog and gtkwave, then downloaded to hardware through Quartus and probed using Signal Tap II.

C: Wrote a program that does computations through pointers instead of variables.
